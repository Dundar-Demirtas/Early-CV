     <h3>Who's Dündar?</h3>   
     <p> Hello everyone! My name is Dündar, I am a senior student at the Department of <a href="https://comd.bilkent.edu.tr/"><strong>Communication and Design </strong></a>. 
     This is my 6th year at Bilkent. I work as a designer and cameraman. At the same time,
      I am a research intern at <a href="https://w3.bilkent.edu.tr/bilkent/">Bilkent. </a>Apart from that,
       I worked as a member of the creative team at several film festivals and planning departments. Currently,
        I am working in a <a href="https://www.tubitak.gov.tr/">TÜBİTAK </a> Project as an undergraduate research fellow. I am also interested in photography,
         image manipulation (montage) and contemporary art. In my spare time, I like to read science fiction novels,
          watch anime and TV series. I just started playing board games. In addition to these,
           going to the theater and visiting exhibitions are two things that attract my artistic and cultural interest.
            It gives me great pleasure to follow and participate in the events in Ankara as much as possible.
             Finally, I can say that I am really a cat person.
